When enabled, DharmaNexus highlights passages in your text that have similarities in other texts in the database. </p> <p>The highlighting is color-coded to create a \"heat map\" that shows the density of intertextual connections at any given point in the text. The colors, from cool to hot, indicate the number of matches found for a particular segment, with the number inside the highlight showing the exact count.

A score of 100 indicates a perfect, verbatim match, while a lower score allows for more variation, showing passages that are semantically similar but not identical.</li> <li>Match Length: Sets the minimum number of characters for a parallel. You might use a shorter length when looking for verse parallels and a longer one for prose to ensure the matches are significant.</li> <li>Limit or Exclude: Focus your search by including or excluding specific collections or texts. For example, you could exclude all commentaries to see only parallels within the canonical texts.</li> </ul> <p>3.

You can upload images or PDFs for OCR and translation. The system supports direct screenshot-to-translation workflows.</p> <p>Q: What is \"English (Explained)\" mode? A: This mode adds grammatical explanations, including word segmentation, lemmatization, and morpho-syntactic analysis, to the translation. See MITRA Translate for more details.</p> <p>Q: What is \"English (Deep Research)\" mode? A: This advanced translation mode provides comprehensive research context by integrating semantic search across all language collections. It includes parallel discovery, contextual analysis, and evidence from secondary literature, making it ideal for serious academic work. See MITRA Deep Research for more details.</p> <p>Q: How do I access Sanskrit grammatical analysis? A: Enter Sanskrit text and click the 'grammar' button to see detailed analysis, including Sandhi segmentation and lemmatization.</p> <p>Q: The Grammar Button disappeared. What happened?

What's wrong? A: The best way to ensure that MITRA Search is finding what you are really looking for is by using the filter option to limit it to texts and collections that you are interested in.</p> <p>Q: Why are the results from the P\u0101li Suttas not always the first? Or the S\u016btras in Sanskrit, Chinese, or Tibetan? A: MITRA Search ranks results primarily by their similarity and relevance to a search query. And while some users might find P\u0101li Suttas as first results most intuitive, this expectation can be very different for other users, and it is therefore difficult to provide a 'one fits all' solution. While we do attempt to rank results in light ways according to chronology as well, this is difficult to achieve consistently, and semantic similarity remains the key factor.</p> <p>Q: Why am I not seeing more than 50 results at a time? A: MITRA Search uses complex and advanced search mechanisms, and due to technical limitations, no more than 50 results can be retrieved at once. If you need more detailed results, we strongly suggest using filters to narrow down the results to specific areas of your interest.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#dharmanexus","title":"DharmaNexus","text":"<p>Q: DharmaNexus, BuddhaNexus, I find this confusing. How do the two projects relate? A: BuddhaNexus was the first prototype of the system (2019-2022), and DharmaNexus is its actively maintained successor platform that's now deeply integrated within the Dharmamitra ecosystem. See the note from our CTO Sebastian for more details.</p> <p>Q: How does DharmaNexus find parallels? A: It uses advanced semantic search and multilingual matching to highlight similar passages across texts and languages.</p> <p>Q: When I flip the 'show match highlighting' switch, I see all kinds of colors on the text, this is super confusing. What does it mean and how does it work? A: The colors are a \"heat map\" that shows you how many similar passages have been found for a given segment of text. You can find a detailed explanation of how this works here.</p> <p>Q: I'm a former BuddhaNexus user. What's different in DharmaNexus? A: DharmaNexus has a few key changes: match highlighting is now off by default (you'll need to enable it), the color scheme is updated for better readability (though the classic BuddhaNexus theme is still available), and search is now powered by the more advanced MITRA Search. Some specific datasets of BuddhaNexus are not available on DharmaNexus, but we are working on offering well-curated improvements in the coming months. </p> <p>Q: Can I use DharmaNexus on my phone? A: Yes and No. You can use it to browse and read texts on your phone, but it's not suited for viewing intertextual connections.

We inherited a significant part of the front- and backend codebase, and thanks to SuttaCentral's commitment to open source licensing under GPL, this was possible, and in fact even encouraged.</p> <p>Of course, the development of BuddhaNexus was primarily possible because of the people creating it, and it is due to ven. Ayya Vimala's dedicated contributions in the early months, including them bringing in additional developers, that we could iterate so fast.

Premodern languages are usually underrepresented in such models, leading to poor performance in downstream applications. The Dharmamitra project aims to develop a diverse set of language models to address these shortcomings for the classical Asian low-resource languages Sanskrit, Tibetan, Classical Chinese, and Pali. These models provide solutions for low-level NLP tasks such as word segmentation and morpho-syntactic tagging, as well as high-level tasks including semantic search, machine translation, and general chatbot interaction. The talk will address the individual challenges and unique characteristics of the data involved, and the strategies deployed to address these.

In my talk, I will demonstrate how these tools are designed and how researchers can access them and integrate them in their workflow.</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html#massive-multilingual-machine-translation-and-search-for-buddhist-languages-the-mitra-project","title":"Massive Multilingual Machine Translation and Search for Buddhist Languages: The Mitra Project","text":"<p>April 2024</p> <p>National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html#dharmamitra-enabling-massive-multilingual-machine-translation-for-ancient-languages-of-the-buddhist-tradition","title":"Dharmamitra: Enabling Massive Multilingual Machine Translation for Ancient Languages of the Buddhist Tradition","text":"<p>March 2024</p> <p>National University of Singapore, Singapore</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html#machine-translation-and-llm-powered-grammatical-explanation-for-sanskrit","title":"Machine Translation and LLM-Powered Grammatical Explanation for Sanskrit","text":"<p>February 2024</p> <p>International Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Conference, Auroville, Puducherry, India (Online presentation)</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html#mitra-developing-natural-language-processing-tools-for-the-languages-of-buddhist-literature","title":"MITRA: Developing Natural Language Processing Tools for the Languages of Buddhist Literature","text":"<p>June 2023</p> <p>Hong Kong</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html#developing-machine-translation-for-ancient-buddhist-texts-in-canonical-languages","title":"Developing Machine Translation for ancient Buddhist texts in canonical languages","text":"<p>June 2023</p> <p>Seoul, Korea</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html#creating-a-shared-semantic-vector-space-for-buddhist-languages","title":"Creating a Shared Semantic Vector Space for Buddhist Languages","text":"<p>April 2023</p> <p>Vienna, Vienna, Austria</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html#multilingual-semantic-mining-for-text-alignment-and-parallel-corpus-building-for-buddhist-languages","title":"Multilingual Semantic Mining for Text Alignment and Parallel Corpus Building for Buddhist Languages","text":"<p>January 2023</p> <p>Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, international symposium 'Perspectives of Digital Humanities in the Field of Buddhist Studies', Hamburg, Germany </p>"},{"location":"publications.html","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"publications.html#relevant-publications","title":"Relevant Publications","text":"<p>Chronological list of key peer\u2011reviewed outputs underpinning the project.</p>"},{"location":"publications.html#2025","title":"2025","text":"<ul> <li>MITRA\u2011zh\u2011eval: Using a Buddhist Chinese Language Evaluation Dataset to Assess Machine Translation and Evaluation Metrics.
