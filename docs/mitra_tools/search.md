## MITRA Search
> *Semantic search across document collections in Pāli, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese available live at [Dharmamitra](https://dharmanexus.org).*

### Features
- Powerful semantic search using state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models and sophisticated linguistic preprocessing 
- search for semantically related passages in the same language and across different languages (Sanskrit to Tibetan, Pāli to Chinese etc.)
- Search for high-level concepts and ideas expressed in modern languages like English 
- Filter options to narrow down results to language, collection, category, and even individual text
- Results link directly into [DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org), where further multilingual parallels and intertextuality can be explored. 

###  How to Use
MITRA Search is a semantic search engine, not a multi-purpose RAG-powered LLM like [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai) or the web search-enabled versions of [Anthropic Claude](https://claude.ai) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com). For those use cases, we recommend trying [MITRA Deep Research](deep_research.md). MITRA Search is therefore not suited to answer general, open-ended questions such as 'the evolution of the term "citta" in early Buddhist literature. Rather, it is very powerful when it comes to locating passages based on topical queries, on semantic content, similar in meaning but different in wording, across language boundaries. This becomes extremely powerful especially in combination with the advanced filter settings. 
MITRA Search is only able to find results that are indexed and contained in the datasets. Please have a look at the DharmaNexus Dataset description to see what data is currently included. You can also browse the data directly at [dharmanexus.org](https://dharmanexus.org). 
### Example Queries 
#### What Works Well 
- **What are the 37 bodhipakṣa-dharmas?**
  - *This query will lead you to sections that define and explain the 37 bodhipakṣa-dharmas. If you are interested about the definition of the bodhipakṣa-dharmas according to specific sections of the literature, i.e. Pāli commentaries, or the works of a single author like Vasubandhu, the best way to achieve this is by using the filter settings to narrow the results down to the type of literature that you are interested in. Queries like `what are the 37 bodhipakṣa-dharmas according to the Pāli tradition` do not work with MITRA Search.*
- **The definition of cetanā**
  - *A lot of texts preserved in different languages contain definitions of key terms like for example cetanā. This query will give you such passages. If you are interested in definitions within specific subsections, like only in Pāli literature, or only in Abhidharma texts, you can use the filter options to narrow down the search space to what you are really interested in.*
- **A verse that compares the suffering of ordinary people with a hair on the palm of the hand**
  - *MITRA Search is a powertool tool to search for semantic queries like this, and is therefore great to trace ideas and concept across the entirety of the datasets. While instructions such as "find me a verse" will not influence the search results much, they can be added for clarity.*
- **Multilingual search: using a Sanskrit sentence or paragraph to find a matching section in Tibetan or Chinese, and the other way round**
  - *
