## MITRA Deep Research

> *Advanced translation mode that provides comprehensive research context by integrating deep semantic search across entire data collections.*

**MITRA Deep Research** is an enhanced translation experience that goes beyond simple text translation. By setting the target language in MITRA Translate to `Deep Research`, users receive not just a translation, but also comprehensive semantic analysis that leverages the full power of [MITRA Search](search.md) and [DharmaNexus](../../dharmanexus.md).

MITRA Deep Research is especially powerful on shorter queries, and we suggest to keep the input limited to a few lines of text: 3-4 verses at once or a coherent paragraph of prose is the upper limit of what MITRA Deep Research can progress at once. Shorter requests might lead to better results. 

### Features
- **Comprehensive Translation**: Enhanced translations that incorporate semantic search results from across all language collections
- **Parallel Discovery**: Automatic identification of parallel passages, translations, and related texts in different languages
- **Contextual Analysis**: Deep semantic search reveals how concepts are expressed across the entire corpus
- **DharmaNexus Integration**: Direct links to [DharmaNexus](../../dharmanexus.md) for exploring intertextual relationships and multilingual parallels
- **Topical Queries**: Support for topical questions like "the definition of cetanƒÅ" with comprehensive literature evidence
- **Evidence-Based Results**: All additional information is sourced from the extensive DharmaNexus database  
- **Integration of Relevant Passages from Secondary Literature**: MITRA Deep Research will automatically check for relevant passages in secondary literature and cite it if good matches appear

This mode provides a significantly superior translation experience by incorporating possibly relevant textual evidence and deeper context, making it ideal for serious translation, research, and academic work.
