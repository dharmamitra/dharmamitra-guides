## MITRA Deep Research

> *Advanced translation mode that provides comprehensive research context by integrating deep semantic search across entire data collections.*

**MITRA Deep Research** is an enhanced translation experience that goes beyond simple text translation. By setting the target language in MITRA Translate to `Deep Research`, users receive not just a translation, but also comprehensive semantic analysis that leverages the full power of [MITRA Search](https://dharmamitra.github.io/dharmamitra-guides/mitra_tools/#mitra-search) and [DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org).

### Features
- **Comprehensive Translation**: Enhanced translations that incorporate semantic search results from across all language collections
- **Parallel Discovery**: Automatic identification of parallel passages, translations, and related texts in different languages
- **Contextual Analysis**: Deep semantic search reveals how concepts are expressed across the entire corpus
- **DharmaNexus Integration**: Direct links to [DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org) for exploring intertextual relationships and multilingual parallels
