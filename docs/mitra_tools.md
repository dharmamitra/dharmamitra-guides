## MITRA Translate

> *Neural machine translation models fine‚Äëtuned for Buddhist domain texts available live at [Dharmamitra](https://dharmamitra.org).*  

We offer free-for-access machine translation capabilities live at [Dharmamitra](https://dharmanexus.org). Currently, our main model uses a combination of in-context-learning and the Gemini API. 

### Languages supported
- Sanskrit ‚Üí English
- PƒÅli ‚Üí English
- Tibetan ‚Üí English
- Classical Chinese ‚Üí English

We primarily focus on English as the target language, but support for other languages is growing. Notably, Korean is also well-supported due to a large user base.

We support translate-from-image, just upload your image to the translator!  

**English Explained Mode:** 
By setting the target language to `English (Explained)`, additional grammatical explanations are added to the translation, based on dedicated grammatical preprocessing models. These explanations include word segmentation, lemmatization, morpho-syntactic analysis, and context-aware meanings for each word.

**Model:** Standalone many-to-one translation model is available on ü§ó [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/buddhist-nlp/gemma-2-mitra-it).

## MITRA Sanskrit Grammar

> *Advanced grammatical analysis for Sanskrit texts with Sandhi segmentation, lemmatization, and detailed morphological annotations available live at [Dharmamitra](https://dharmamitra.org).*

We provide comprehensive grammatical analysis capabilities for Sanskrit powered by [ByT5-Sanskrit](https://dharmamitra.github.io/dharmamitra-guides/mitra_models/#byt5-sanskrit) model. This model represents the current state of the art for Sanskrit NLP, with an error rate roughly 50% lower than previous models and approaching the accuracy of a single human expert annotator.

### Features
- **Sandhi Segmentation**: Automatic breaking down of compound words and Sandhi formations
- **Lemmatization**: Identification of base forms and dictionary entries for each word
- **Grammatical Tags**: Detailed morphological analysis including case, gender, number, tense, mood, and voice
- **Lexical Candidates**: Multiple possible meanings and interpretations for each word
- **Interactive Interface**: Click the 'grammar' button after entering Sanskrit text to access detailed annotations

### How to Use
- Enter a Sanskrit sentence into the translation field at [Dharmamitra](https://dharmamitra.org)
- Click the 'grammar' button that appears
- A side menu opens displaying comprehensive grammatical analysis including Sandhi segmentation, lemmatization, and grammatical tags
- Explore lexical candidates and morphological details for each word!

### Technical Details
[ByT5-Sanskrit](https://dharmamitra.github.io/dharmamitra-guides/mitra_models/#byt5-sanskrit) is a grammatical annotation model trained on the [Digital Corpus of Sanskrit](http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/) by Oliver Hellwig

## MITRA Search
> *Semantic search across document collections in PƒÅli, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese available live at [Dharmamitra](https://dharmanexus.org).*

### Features
- Powerful semantic search using state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models and sophisticated linguistic preprocessing 
- search for semantically related passages in the same language and across different languages (Sanskrit to Tibetan, PƒÅli to Chinese etc.)
- Search for high-level concepts and ideas expressed in modern languages like English 
- Filter options to narrow down results to language, collection, category, and even individual text
- Results link directly into [DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org), where further multilingual parallels and intertextuality can be explored.

## MITRA Deep Research

> *Advanced translation mode that provides comprehensive research context by integrating deep semantic search across entire data collections.*

**MITRA Deep Research** is an enhanced translation experience that goes beyond simple text translation. By setting the target language in MITRA Translate to `Deep Research`, users receive not just a translation, but also comprehensive semantic analysis that leverages the full power of [MITRA Search](https://dharmamitra.github.io/dharmamitra-guides/mitra_tools/#mitra-search) and [DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org).

### Features
- **Comprehensive Translation**: Enhanced translations that incorporate semantic search results from across all language collections
- **Parallel Discovery**: Automatic identification of parallel passages, translations, and related texts in different languages
- **Contextual Analysis**: Deep semantic search reveals how concepts are expressed across the entire corpus
- **DharmaNexus Integration**: Direct links to [DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org) for exploring intertextual relationships and multilingual parallels
- **Topical Queries**: Support for topical questions like "the definition of cetanƒÅ" with comprehensive literature evidence
- **Evidence-Based Results**: All additional information is sourced from the extensive DharmaNexus database  
- **Integration of Relevant Passages from Secondary Literature**: MITRA Deep Research will automatically check for relevant passages in secondary literature and cite it if good matches appear

This mode provides a significantly superior translation experience by incorporating possibly relevant textual evidence and deeper context, making it ideal for serious translation, research, and academic work.
