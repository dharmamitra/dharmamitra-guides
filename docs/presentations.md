### Machine Translation for Asian Studies
**March 2025**

*Annual Conference of the Association of Asian Studies, Columbus, Ohio*

With the advent of large language models, machine translation (MT) has become a widely used, but little understood, tool for research, language learning, and communication. GPT, Claude, and many other model series allow researchers now to access literature in different languages, and even translate primary texts composed in classical languages with few resources available. But how to evaluate the translation output of such machines? How to decide which model is the best for my own research purposes and how to tweak it? How will MT impact language learning, which is fundamental for Asian Studies?

In the first part of this session, we will give an overview of the MT landscape for Asian Studies. Participants will learn how to use online interfaces and APIs to access language models for their own research needs. We will discuss different types of prompts and user defined parameters such as temperature or token length. We will demonstrate that results can differ radically according to parameterization and prompting, both within the same model and between models.

In the second part we will present Dharmamitra (dharmamitra.org), an open-source model trained on low-resource languages relevant for Asian Studies. Using examples from Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, and Classical Chinese we will show how even difficult, ancient languages are slowly becoming tractable for MT and what caveats to consider when using such language models to translate them.

This is a hands-on workshop with exercises. Participants will have to bring their computers. Programming experience is not needed.

### **[MITRA Search](https://dharmamitra.github.io/dharmamitra-guides/mitra_tools/search/)**: Building Information Retrieval Systems for Classical Asian Languages in the Age of AI
**March 2025**

*CEAL (Council on East Asian Libraries) Technology Forum, Columbus, Ohio*

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and natural language processing have revolutionized information retrieval and question-answering systems. This talk introduces **[MITRA Search](https://dharmamitra.github.io/dharmamitra-guides/mitra_tools/search/)**, a specialized search platform designed for exploring Buddhist literature preserved across Classical Asian languages including Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and Pāli. The system leverages multilingual approximate search capabilities to enable scholars to identify parallel passages and conduct comparative analyses across different writing systems and translations. We demonstrate how large language models integrated into the Dharmamitra project enhance user interaction with search results, facilitating dynamic exploration of these classical texts. This innovation addresses the long-standing challenge of cross-linguistic textual research in Buddhist studies and offers new possibilities for digital humanities scholarship.

### Dharmamitra
**November 2024**

*Online - via Zoom, Heidelberg, Germany*

[Recording available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMD6RGr-w9Q)

Sanskrit presents unique challenges for digital processing due to the language's rich morphological complexity and the absence of word boundaries in written texts. While recent advances in Natural Language Processing have revolutionized the study of modern languages and made applications such as machine translation and reliable search engines possible, Sanskrit so far is lagging behind in these developments. In this talk, I will present Dharmamitra's Sanskrit-specific capabilities, particularly our new language model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in fundamental Sanskrit processing tasks such as word segmentation, lemmatization, and morphological analysis. I will demonstrate how these technical advances translate into practical tools for Sanskrit scholars – from assisting in basic text analysis to enabling sophisticated corpus-wide semantic search and machine translation. The talk will showcase examples of how our system can provide detailed grammatical explanations, annotated translations, and facilitate textual research via semantic search even across language boundaries. These tools are designed to serve both beginning Sanskrit students and advanced scholars conducting specialized research. I will also demonstrate how Dharmamitra's capabilities can be used as building blocks for Sanskrit digitization and annotation projects.

### MITRA: Beyond Just Machine Translation for Premodern Asian Low Resource Languages
**October 2024**

*Johns Hopkins University, Center for Language and Speech Processing, Baltimore, MD, USA*

Recent years saw the rise of multilingual language models that achieve high levels of performance for a large number of tasks, with some of them handling hundreds of languages at once. Premodern languages are usually underrepresented in such models, leading to poor performance in downstream applications. The Dharmamitra project aims to develop a diverse set of language models to address these shortcomings for the classical Asian low-resource languages Sanskrit, Tibetan, Classical Chinese, and Pali. These models provide solutions for low-level NLP tasks such as word segmentation and morpho-syntactic tagging, as well as high-level tasks including semantic search, machine translation, and general chatbot interaction. The talk will address the individual challenges and unique characteristics of the data involved, and the strategies deployed to address these. It will also demonstrate how these different tools can be combined in an application that goes beyond simple sentence-to-sentence machine translation, providing detailed grammatical explanations and corpus-wide search to support both early-stage language learners and experienced researchers with specific demands.

### MITRA: Developing Language Models for Machine Translation and Search in Buddhist Source Languages
**August 2024**

*PNC 2024 Annual Conference and Joint Meetings, Seoul, Korea*

Translation and search are among the fundamental problems when researching the textual source material of Buddhist traditions. MITRA has successfully developed machine translation models to ease the access to this material. When it comes to search, The Dharmamitra project approaches this problem by using semantic embeddings that enable search on related passages in different languages, regardless of whether the answer to the query is found in a text preserved in Pāli, Sanskrit, Tibetan, or Chinese. In addition to providing researchers with this powerful search system, Dharmamitra also provides a system for the automatic detection of similar text passages within the same language and across different languages. In my talk, I will demonstrate how these tools are designed and how researchers can access them and integrate them in their workflow.
