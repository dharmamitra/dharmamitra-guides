## DharmaNexus

**[DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org)** is a web platform for the exploration of intertextuality for literature preserved in Pāli, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan. Its technical foundation and user interface are a continuation of [BuddhaNexus](https://buddhanexus.net), and it is tightly integrated into MITRASearch and provides modernized algorithms that integrate sophisticated multilingual matching with deep semantic similarity capabilities provided by [Gemma 2 MITRA-E](https://huggingface.co/buddhist-nlp/gemma-2-mitra-e).

### How it Works

DharmaNexus helps you find intertextual connections within and between texts in Pāli, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan.

**1. Select a text:** Choose a language and then select a text to analyze. This is the text from where the exploration starts.

**2. See the matches:** DharmaNexus automatically highlights passages in your text that have similarities in other texts in the database. This is done via a colored heatmap that indicates the amount of textual reuse at a given position. When you click on a highlighted passage, the platform shows you the overlapping text sections from other texts in a new column.

**3. Filter your results:** You can narrow down the matches with filters:
*   **Similarity Score:** Control how similar the text passages should be.
*   **Match Length:** Set a minimum length for matches.
*   **Limit or Exclude:** Focus your search on specific collections or texts.

**4. Choose your view:** DharmaNexus provides different ways to see the results:
*   **Text View:** The default view, showing your text with highlighted matches.
*   **Table View:** A sortable table of all matches.
*   **Graph View:** Charts that visualize where matches are found.
*   **Numbers View:** Uses standard numbering systems to locate matches in Pāli and Chinese texts.
