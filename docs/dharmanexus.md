## DharmaNexus

**[DharmaNexus](https://dharmanexus.org)** is a web platform for the exploration of intertextuality for literature preserved in PƒÅli, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan. Its technical foundation and user interface are a continuation of [BuddhaNexus](https://buddhanexus.net), and it is tightly integrated into MITRASearch and provides modernized algorithms that integrate sophisticated multilingual matching with deep semantic similarity capabilities provided by [Gemma 2 MITRA-E](https://huggingface.co/buddhist-nlp/gemma-2-mitra-e).
